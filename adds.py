Define the Domain-Specific Agent Class:
python
Copy code
class DomainSpecificAgent(autogen.ConversableAgent):
    def __init__(self, name, domain_knowledge_path, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(name, *args, **kwargs)
        self.domain_knowledge = self.load_domain_knowledge(domain_knowledge_path)

    def load_domain_knowledge(self, file_path):
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            return file.readlines()

    async def a_get_response(self, prompt):
        # Sample logic: search for a line containing a keyword from the prompt
        response = "I'm sorry, I don't have information on that topic."
        for line in self.domain_knowledge:
            if prompt.lower() in line.lower():
                response = line
                break
        return response
Instantiate the Domain-Specific Agent:
Add this code where you initialize your agents. Replace "path/to/domain_knowledge.txt" with the path to your domain-specific text document.
python
Copy code
domain_agent = DomainSpecificAgent(name="domain_agent", domain_knowledge_path="path/to/domain_knowledge.txt")
Set up Communication Between Agents:
You need to define how the domain-specific agent will receive and send messages. You might want to modify the existing communication setup to include the new agent. Here's an example of how you might set this up:
python
Copy code
# Register reply functions for the domain-specific agent
domain_agent.register_reply(
    [autogen.Agent, None],
    reply_func=print_messages, 
    config={"callback": None},
) 
Integrate the Domain-Specific Agent into the Chat Flow:
Modify your callback function or chat initiation logic to include the domain-specific agent. For example, you could modify the callback function to send some user inputs to the domain-specific agent:
python
Copy code
async def callback(contents: str, user: str, instance: pn.chat.ChatInterface):
    global initiate_chat_task_created
    global input_future
    global gpt_assistant
    global domain_agent

    # Logic to determine which agent should respond
    if "special topic" in contents.lower():  # Replace 'special topic' with a relevant keyword
        response = await domain_agent.a_get_response(contents)
        chat_interface.send(response, user=domain_agent.name, avatar=avatar[domain_agent.name], respond=False)
    else:
        # Existing logic for handling chat with GPT assistant
        if not initiate_chat_task_created:
            asyncio.create_task(delayed_initiate_chat(user_proxy, gpt_assistant, contents))
        else:
            if input_future and not input_future.done():
                input_future.set_result(contents)
            else:
                print("There is currently no input being awaited.")
Make sure you integrate this new logic properly into your existing application flow. Test thoroughly to ensure that the new agent interacts seamlessly with other components and handles user inputs as expected.
